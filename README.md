# How to set up the app

For setting up the frontend app you need to install:

- Node: https://nodejs.org/en/

- React: `npm install -g react react-dom`

- Vite: `npm install -g vite@latest`

After you installed all the above, go to the `/src` folder in the project and install node modules: `npm install`

When you want to run the app you will need to run: `npm run dev`


That's it :)
